This group explored the posibility of using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and a NoIR camera connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero W to construct a better gate counter, one that would actually count egress and ingress traffic rather than just detect some form of movement.
It was an ambitious project to undertake in a few hours, especially with the Pi Zero as compiling code introduced long delays.  Another day or two to work out issues encountered in adapting the example code is probably required.
Included here is the original OpenCV example, and a version of the code adapted for the Pi camera.
