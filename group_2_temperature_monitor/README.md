# Temperature Monitor

Using the AM2302 (wired DHT22) temperature-humidity sensor, this group wrote an application that monitors the temperature, and when a specific threshold is exceeded, an email warning is sent out and a buzzer sounds every 10 seconds.
When the temperature drops below the threshold, the buzzer will stop, and a follow-up email will be sent.

The test setup involved a hot cup of coffee (hence the name of Python script and the witty messages it sent) and a cold cup of water.  The sensor was placed against one of these cups to raise or lower the temperature.

A system like this could be useful for locations (like Archives and Special Collections) where changes in temperatire or humidity may need to be monitored.
